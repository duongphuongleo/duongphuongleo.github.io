# Codes and Standards_W26 - Instructor: Tim Gignac
We develop understanding and application of practical standards from organizations such as the Ministry of Transportation Ontario (MTO), Ontario Provincial Standards (OPS), and municipal requirements. We then explore the application of these standards in CAD design and Appendix specification writing. 
Topics includes:
- Ministry of Transportation Ontario (MTO); Geometric Design Standards and Drainage Management Manuals
- 👉 Transportation Association of Canada (TAC); Geometric Design for Canadian Roads

- Ontario Provincial Standards (OPS), OPSSpecification and OPSDrawings

- Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks (MECP); Design Guidelines for Sewage and for Drinking Water, Stormwater Management Design Manuals
Conservation Authorities; Lake Simcoe Region Conservation Authority (LSRCA), Lake Simcoe Protection Plan (LSPP), and Nottawasaga Conservation Authority (NVCA)
- 👉 Low Impact Development (LID) and Sustainable Technologies Evaluation Program (STEP)

- Ontario Building Code (OBC)
- 👉 Municipal Class Septic Design
- 👉 Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA)

- Roadside safety 3hr hybrid session (Book 7) externally provided by Safety Co. Partners


# Material Science - Instructor: Michael Scott
The course introduces us to construction materials, including types of soils, aggregates involved in concrete and asphalt mix, and their applications in civil engineering projects. We're introduced to engineering standards and the standard test methods associated with these construction materials.
