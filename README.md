# surveying-2d-simulator-version0 
(Brainstorming for this side Activity Project and Earliest working version of the simulator started: Jan5, 2026)
Early prototype — browser-based 2D Surveying Simulator.  
This is my first working version of an interactive differential levelling practice tool, built to help beginners visualize surveying concepts. 
I’m actively improving usability, realism, and feedback systems as I continue my Civil Engineering diploma.
