# surveying-2d-simulator-version0 (Prototype of a browser-based 2D Surveying Simulator)
(Brainstorming for this side Activity Project and Earliest working version of the simulator started: Jan5, 2026)
This is my first working version of an interactive differential levelling practice tool, built to help beginners visualize surveying concepts. 
As I’m actively improving the simulator's usability, realism, and feedback systems, I continue to gain the practice time and the practial equipment skill in my Surveying 2 in the 2nd semester.
